    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Python and flask are my "first love". very stable, workflow is beautiful, can build anything & an absolute joy to code in. I was able to create an app that tracks prices on Amazon & other major online retailers by simply scrapping their sites & using mailgun to send email when my desired price was reached & I did it all in one weekend
